saf: Sustainable Aviation Fuel
==============================

Summary
-------
This module includes a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)-based system for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and valuable coproducts (hydrogen and fertilizers) from wet organic wastes (manuscript to be submitted [1]_).

Two system configurations are included in the module describing the three scenarios discussed in the manuscript, but the system diagram looks identical (the electrochemical [EC] unit is a placeholder that does nothing in the baseline scenario).

Directly running the `systems.py` (different configurations can be chosen by uncommenting the corresponding configuration kwargs), the /analyses_ directory includes two sensitivity analyses (with regard to plant size and biocrude yield).
